A useful tool to help calculate your score, and attach an image of your game board when playing online with others.

# Functions
There are various ways buildings receive scores in this game, so that job will be up to the player. Enter the building score in on the left, and once all the scores have been entered click calculate total to populate the total score.

Clicking the add image button will bring up windows explorer and allow you to select a picture to be added.

Clicking the clear card button will remove the builder name, all entry points, and the image added. There is no save functionality in this app. If you would like to save, or post a score I would recommend taking a screenshot at this time.

Currently, I probably have 1 hour in this project. In the future I may come back to update the graphics, and potentially add some additional functionality. This is free software please use it as you wish. I hope others that use it find it helpful. Happy gaming!
